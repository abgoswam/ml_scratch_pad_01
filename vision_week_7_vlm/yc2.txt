OpenForge is a platform that acts as a coach for AI agents. It plugs into any existing agent, observes real behavior, attributes rewards, and fine-tunes an underlying LLM toward specific business KPIs. The result is agents that perform reliably in real applications like planning, browsing, and coding. Our core philosophy is simplicity. With just a few lines of code, enterprises can integrate OpenForge into their existing systems. The platform then runs Agentic Reinforcement Learning to continuously improve performance. Our moat comes from (1) RL optimization techniques designed around business KPIs, and (2) the infrastructure required to run stable, scalable agent-environment rollouts. OpenForge also provides full debugging and reliability visibility across the agent loop—from reasoning traces to environment actions. Today, most agents are unreliable because they rely on black-box LLMs. OpenForge makes agents reliable, goal-aligned, and production-ready, giving enterprises the confidence to deploy agentic workflows at scale. 

> How far along are you? 

We already have the core training loop working for two demo agents: one for coding and one for travel planning. The system can observe task execution, attribute rewards, and fine-tune the underlying LLM to improve task completion. We are now generalizing the framework to support additional agent workflows (planning, browsing, and internal tool agents). We are actively refining the API, strengthening the rollout infrastructure, and benchmarking performance on real enterprise-style workloads. We will run a private alpha with design partners in January, followed by a public v0.1 release in Q1 2026. 

> When will you have a version people can use? 

We already have the core training loop working for two demo agents: one for coding and one for travel planning. We’re now generalizing the framework to support broader agent workflows (planning, browsing, and internal tool agents). We will run a private alpha with design partners in January, followed by a public v0.1 release in Q1 2026. Right now, we’re focused on: 1. API and integration simplicity, 2. stable, scalable rollout infrastructure, and 3. tuning and benchmarking on real enterprise agent workloads. 

> Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making? 

We picked this idea because we consistently see enterprises struggle with unreliable agents. We’ve spoken with teams across finance, legal, dev tooling, and professional services who have agents in-house, but they break unpredictably and aren’t production ready. The common workaround is to bolt on guardrails and patch prompts, which is brittle and hard to maintain. These teams want agents that improve over time, align to business goals, and in many cases, they want to own and fine-tune their LLMs. They don’t have the infrastructure or expertise to build Agentic RL to do this. We have deep experience here. We’ve already solved this problem for coding agents, where we built RL pipelines to observe behavior, assign rewards, and fine-tune the LLM to improve task completion. OpenForge is us productizing that capability so any enterprise agent can benefit from the same training loop. 

> How do or will you make money? How much could you make? 

We will sell OpenForge as a self-hosted enterprise platform that runs inside the customer’s own cloud/VPC, so all agent data and reasoning traces remain internal. Pricing will be an annual license tied to the number of agents and training workloads, with optional onboarding, support, and rollout/evaluation orchestration services. Today, OpenForge is a Python library with working demo agents, and we are productizing it into a deployable enterprise package as we onboard design partners. OpenForge is to agent training and reliability what Ray/Anyscale is to distributed ML: start with a simple Python library and become the standard enterprise orchestration layer. The market is large—if we become that standard, this is a multi-billion-dollar platform opportunity.
